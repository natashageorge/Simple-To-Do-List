# Simple-To-Do-List
Simple To Do List using JavaScript

-Uses Local Storage for storing to-do items.

-Support deleting to-do items.

-Support marking to-do items as done.

-Support a basic text search over the "task" and "who" fields (so I can search by person or word in task).

-Support for dates, showing how many days until a task is due, or how many days overdue a task is.

-Use Exception handling for potential errors in Date processing.

-Support Geolocation, so a task has a location associated with it.

-Use Modernizr to separate Local Storage and Geolocation code from the main code. Your application should still function properly (although, obviously, with less capability) even if Local Storage and Geolocation are not supported.
